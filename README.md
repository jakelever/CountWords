# CountWords

This is a dummy text mining tool for testing ideas for integration into the [OpenMinTeD platform](https://services.openminted.eu/). Basically the tool will just load an XMI file and count the number of words. Simples.

This code is based on one of the example projects from the [PubRunner repo](https://github.com/jakelever/pubrunner).
